It is installed by cloning the repo and running "npm i" in the terminal. Make sure you initialize and seed the database before trying to run it (Requires MySQL and Node).

## Usage

It is mostly just to showcase my ability to use MySQL. You may use it yourself, but I am sure there are plenty of better alternatives lol.
